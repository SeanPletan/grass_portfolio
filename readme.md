# Grass Portfolio

This is my fourth portfolio version within a year. The goal is to make a scene of at least hundreds of thousands of moving, procedurally generated grass blades using instaced meshes, frustrum culling, chunk loading, level of detail, fog, and postprocessing effects. It is coded in vanilla Three.js.
